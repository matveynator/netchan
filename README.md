## Overview
`netchan` stands as a robust library for the Go programming language, offering convenient and secure abstractions for network channel interactions. Inspired by Rob Pike’s initial concept, it aims to deliver an interface that resonates with the simplicity and familiarity of Go’s native channels.

## Key Features
- **Ease of Use**: The library’s interface is intuitively designed, mirroring the standard channel operations in Go, ensuring a seamless integration for Go developers.
- **Secure by default**: Emphasizing security, `netchan` employs cutting-edge encryption techniques, alongside reliable authentication and authorization practices, ensuring the integrity and "security by default" of your network communications.
- **Scalability**: Crafted with distributed systems in mind, `netchan` excels in environments demanding high throughput and scalability.
- **High Performance**: Performance is paramount; hence, `netchan` is meticulously optimized to ensure low overhead and swift data transmissions.
- **Network Adherence to CSP Principles**: Complete alignment with the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) model as articulated by Tony Hoare, extended to function at the network layer.
- **Principles of Pure Go Programming**: A seamless adherence to the [Go proverbs](https://go-proverbs.github.io), harmonizing the coding practices with the most esteemed and recognized conventions of Go programming principles.
