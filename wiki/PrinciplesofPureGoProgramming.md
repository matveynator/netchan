"Principles of Pure Go Programming" refers to adhering to the best practices, idiomatic patterns, and design philosophies inherent to the Go programming language. Specifically, in the case of netchan library, this could encompass several key aspects:

1. **Simplicity and Readability**: Go is known for its emphasis on simplicity. Writing code that is straightforward and easy to understand is a core principle. This means avoiding overly complex constructs and favoring clear, concise code.

2. **Efficient Concurrency**: Go's concurrency model, centered around goroutines and channels, is one of its defining features. Adhering to these principles would mean effectively leveraging these constructs for concurrent processing, which is likely very relevant for a network library like "netchan".

3. **Composition over Inheritance**: Go does not support traditional object-oriented inheritance; instead, it encourages composition. This could manifest in your library as favoring the composition of smaller, modular components over large, complex inheritance hierarchies.

4. **Interface-based Design**: Go's interfaces are implicitly implemented, allowing for flexible and decoupled designs. For "netchan", this might involve defining clear interfaces for network operations, making the library adaptable and easy to integrate with other systems.

5. **Error Handling**: Go handles errors explicitly rather than using exceptions. Following pure Go principles would mean adopting this explicit error handling consistently throughout your library, ensuring errors are properly checked and handled.

6. **Efficiency and Performance**: Go is designed for high performance, with features like garbage collection and native support for concurrent processing. Adhering to pure Go principles would involve optimizing your library for performance and efficiency, ensuring it can handle high workloads with minimal overhead.

7. **Standard Library Utilization**: Go has a powerful standard library. Leveraging these well-tested and optimized packages wherever appropriate, instead of reinventing the wheel, is a hallmark of idiomatic Go programming.

In summary, "Principles of Pure Go Programming" in the context of netchan library development plan would involve embracing these key Go idioms and practices, ensuring that "netchan" is developed in a way that is true to the spirit and strengths of the Go language.
