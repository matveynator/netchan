Development Roadmap for the "netchan" Library in Golang
Feel free to contribute your ideas and suggestions!

## General Goals and Principles
1. **Ease of Use**: The library’s interface should be intuitively understandable and reflect standard channel operations in Go.
2. **Secure by Default**: The library should employ modern encryption techniques, as well as reliable practices for authentication and authorization.
3. **Scalability**: Suitable for distributed systems, providing high throughput and scalability.
4. **High Performance**: Optimized to ensure low overhead and rapid data transfer.
5. **Network Adherence to CSP Principles**: Full compliance with the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) model.
6. **Principles of Pure Go Programming**: Adherence to the principles of pure Go programming.

## Package Structure
1. **Network Interaction Functions**
   - `ListenAndServe`: Handling incoming connections.
   - `Dial`: Initiating outgoing connections.
   - Both methods should utilize interfaces to facilitate future modifications and enhance functionality.
   - Implementation of a mechanism for file descriptor transmission to ensure graceful restart without losing current connections.

2. **Connection Management**
   - Automatic tracking of connected and disconnected clients.
   - Re-establishing connections in case of loss.
   - Identifying clients and corresponding channels using unique and secure keys.

3. **Buffer and Broadcast**
   - Implementing a network-level equivalent of Go’s channel buffer.
   - A handshake-broadcast mechanism to distribute initial tasks to all clients, with only those who respond first receiving tasks according to the queue size (buffer).
   - A “first come, first served” system to determine who receives a task.

4. **Channels and Encryption**
   - Initialization functions return a channel through which serviced channels are subsequently transmitted and received.
   - Using unique keys for each channel.
   - All network channels utilize maximum TLS encryption by default.
   - Optionally using shared encryption keys, blocking connection to the port in their absence.

5. **Storing Shared Encryption Keys**
   - Encryption keys, used for connecting to the server, are stored inside the binary file.
   - Utilizing obfuscation and key splitting, as well as the `go:embed` format, to prevent decompilation from binary code.

## Implementation
1. **Interfaces and Abstractions**: 
   - Defining interfaces for network operations, allowing for easy expansion and modification of functionality.

2. **Security and Encryption**: 
   - Integrating modern encryption and security libraries.
   - Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms.

3. **State Management and Error Handling**: 
   - Monitoring connection status and managing errors.
   - Automatically recovering after connection loss.
