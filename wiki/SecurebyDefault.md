"Secure by Default" means that our netchan library is designed with security as a fundamental and integral aspect, rather than as an afterthought or an optional addition. Here's what this principle entails in our case:

1. **Modern Encryption Techniques**:
   - The library uses up-to-date and robust encryption methods to protect data during transmission.
   - This might involve implementing TLS (Transport Layer Security) or similar protocols to ensure that all data transferred over the network is encrypted and secure from eavesdropping or tampering.

2. **Authentication and Authorization Practices**:
   - The library includes mechanisms to verify the identity of clients and servers. This could mean integrating with existing authentication systems or developing a custom solution.
   - Authorization is also critical, ensuring that once a client is authenticated, it only has access to the resources and operations that it is permitted to use.

3. **Security in Design and Implementation**:
   - Security considerations are embedded in the design phase of the library and throughout its implementation.
   - This approach includes writing secure code, protecting against common vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows, injection attacks), and regularly updating the library to address new security threats.

4. **Default Security Settings**:
   - The library is configured with secure defaults. This means that without any additional setup or configuration, the library operates in a secure manner.
   - Users of the library don't have to be security experts to benefit from these security features. The library aims to provide strong security out of the box.

5. **Documentation and Guidance for Secure Usage**:
   - Providing clear documentation on how to use the library securely, including guidelines on setting up secure connections, managing encryption keys, and other best practices.

"Secure by Default" in the context of our netchan library thus emphasizes a proactive, comprehensive approach to security, ensuring that every aspect of network communication is secure, from the establishment of connections to the transfer of data.
