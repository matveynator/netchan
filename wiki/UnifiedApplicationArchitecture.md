"Unified Application Architecture" refers to a design philosophy where all components of a networked application (each client and server) are developed and function as parts of a single, cohesive system. This concept is particularly relevant given the bidirectional client-server roles and the distributed nature of the system. Here's what it entails:

1. **Seamless Integration**: Each node (be it a client or server) in the network is not just an isolated entity but a part of the larger application architecture. This means that every action taken by a node is in the context of the collective network behavior.

2. **Collaboration Enhancement**: The architecture is designed to facilitate and improve collaboration between different parts of the application. In a traditional client-server model, clients and servers have distinct roles and responsibilities. The unified approach blurs these lines, allowing every node to contribute more dynamically to the application's function.

3. **Data Flow and Management**: In a unified architecture, data flow is more streamlined and coherent, as all parts of the application are designed to work together harmoniously. This can lead to more efficient data processing and management, as the data doesn't have to be translated or adapted significantly as it moves through different parts of the network.

4. **Decentralization**: By enabling each client to also function as a server, the architecture promotes a decentralized approach. This can enhance the resilience and scalability of the application, as the network doesn't rely on a single point of failure and can scale out (add more nodes) more easily.

5. **Consistent User Experience**: From a user's perspective, a unified application architecture can provide a more consistent and integrated experience, as the underlying complexities of the network interactions are abstracted away.

In summary, "Unified Application Architecture" in our plan for the netchan library signifies an approach where each participating node is an integral part of a larger system, working in unison towards common goals, thus creating a more robust, efficient, and cohesive networked application.
